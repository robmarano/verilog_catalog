# Verilog Catalog Template

This is your catalog of Verilog-modeled logical circuits used to implement the computer architecture for your von Neumann-classified computer design (CPU, memory, data path, input, output).

Each catalog component will be stored in its own respective folder. To compile, simulate, and verify simulation using GTKWave, you will issue the following commands in each of the catalog component folders.

## Compilation and Simulation
To compile then simulate:
### Linux, MacOS
```bash
make clean compile simulate
```

### Windows
```powershell
.\makefile.ps1
```

# Display of Timing Diagrams
To display simulation using GTKWAVE:

### Linux, MacOS
```bash
make display
```

### Windows
```powershell
.\display.ps1
```

Then choose your module's test bench module (`uut`), as your SST. Highlight "uut" and choose all signals, dragging them to Signal area to right. Once done, got to menu Time -> Zoom -> Zoom Bet Fit.

# Clean up the compiled and simulated files
To clean up:

### Linux, MacOS
```bash
make clean
```

### Windows
```powershell
.\clean.ps1
```
# Committing Work to GitHub
From within your Terminal, issue the following commands, on Linux/MacOS/Windows:
```bash
git status
git add *
git commit -a -m "Write something here that describes what you are committing to the catalog repository"
git push
git pull
```
